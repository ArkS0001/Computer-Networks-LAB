DETAILED SYLLABUS
1. Implementation of Stop and Wait Protocol and Sliding Window Protocol.
2. Study of Socket Programming and Client – Server model
3. Write a code simulating ARP /RARP protocols.
4. Write a code simulating PING and TRACEROUTE commands
5. Create a socket for HTTP for web page upload and download.
6. Write a program to implement RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
7. Implementation of Subnetting .
8. Applications using TCP Sockets like
a. Echo client and echo server b. Chat c. File Transfer
9. Applications using TCP and UDP Sockets like d. DNS e. SNMP f. File Transfer
10. Study of Network simulator (NS).and Simulation of Congestion Control Algorithms using NS
11. Perform a case study about the different routing algorithms to select the network path with its optimum and
economical during data transfer. i. Link State routing ii. Flooding iii. Distance vector
12. To learn handling and configuration of networking hardware like RJ-45 connector, CAT-6 cable, crimping tool, etc.
13. Configuration of router, hub, switch etc. (using real devices or simulators)
14. Running and using services/commands like ping, traceroute, nslookup, arp, telnet, ftp, etc.
15.Network packet analysis using tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, etc.
16. Network simulation using tools like Cisco Packet Tracer, NetSim, OMNeT++, NS2, NS3, etc.
17.Socket programming using UDP and TCP (e.g., simple DNS, data & time client/server, echo client/server, iterative &
concurrent servers)
Note: The Instructor may add/delete/modify/tune experiments, wherever he/she feels in a justified manner
It is also suggested that open source tools should be preferred to conduct the lab ( C , C++ , Java , NS3,
Mininet, Opnet, TCP Dump, Wireshark etc
